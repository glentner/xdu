# Invariant gate & footgun checklist

A curated, explicitly-enumerated subset of the load-bearing invariants in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), maintained **in lockstep with it** (`AGENTS.md` is ground truth — if
this drifts, fix it). Two consumers:

- **`xdu-plan` (gate):** before research *and* after PLAN/TECH is drafted, walk the sections a change
  touches and confirm the design honors each. Record any bend in PLAN's deviation-justification table.
- **`xdu-review` (footgun list):** a violation of any §1–§12 invariant here — **lettered subsections
  such as §2b/§2c included** — is **auto-CRITICAL** and,
  when it touches a high-blast-radius file, forces a human sign-off gate. A §13 project-conventions
  violation is **HIGH**, not auto-CRITICAL.

Only invoke the sections relevant to the change — do not manufacture findings against untouched
subsystems.

## High-blast-radius files (any CONFIRMED finding here → mandatory human gate)

`src/bin/xdu-rm.rs` (destructive) · `src/bin/xdu.rs` (crawl concurrency scaffold + marker sequencing) ·
`src/crawl.rs` (atomic finalize + stale-chunk prune + reserved-index-name collision rejection) ·
`src/lib.rs` (schema + `QueryFilters`/SQL + `index_glob` + layout constants + `RESERVED_INDEX_NAMES`) ·
`src/cli.rs` (the one CLI definition)

---

## 1. Parquet schema stability (`src/lib.rs::get_schema`) — highest blast radius

- `get_schema()` is the sole writer↔reader contract: exactly **three non-null** fields, fixed order —
  `path: Utf8`, `size: Int64`, `atime: Int64`. `size` is bytes as `i64` (meaning depends on the
  `SizeMode` chosen at index time — disk-usage vs apparent vs block-rounded — and is **not** recorded
  in the index); `atime` is Unix epoch seconds as `i64`.
- There is **no on-disk schema version.** Any change to `get_schema()` or a reader's `read_parquet`
  column list is a **breaking, cross-cutting** index-format change touching `lib.rs` + the crawler +
  all three readers + every README `read_parquet` example. `get_schema()` is the *only* in-code
  statement of the row shape — there is deliberately no mirror struct to drift out of step with it.
- Issues #2 / #3 (add `owner`/`group`/`permissions`) are exactly this class — **require adding a
  schema version field before evolving the schema.**

## 2. Atomic finalization (`src/crawl.rs::PartitionBuffer::finalize`)

- Write each chunk to `NNNNNN.parquet.partial`, then `fs::rename` to `.parquet` **within the same
  directory** (POSIX-atomic); prune stale higher-numbered `.parquet` chunks left by a prior larger run.
- Never `File::create` a final `.parquet`, never cross-directory rename (breaks atomicity), never let
  a reader glob `.partial`.
- **Known limitation:** finalize is per-file, **not** per-partition atomic — a reader during finalize
  can see a mix of new and old chunks, and a crash mid-finalize leaves the partition inconsistent. Do
  **not** index a partition concurrently with purging it; document this rather than pretending
  otherwise.

## 2b. Run-level completion marker (`<index>/.xdu-complete`)

Per-chunk atomicity (§2) covers one *file*; it cannot express whether the **run** finished. When one
driver fails, the partitions that already succeeded remain on disk as real `.parquet` chunks,
indistinguishable from a complete index. The marker is the only thing that separates them, so its
ordering is load-bearing:

- `COMPLETION_MARKER` = `.xdu-complete` (`lib.rs`), at the **index root**. A dotfile, so the readers'
  `*/*.parquet` glob never mistakes it for a partition — and a **reserved name** (§3), so a partition is
  never written over the marker either. Both directions, or the outdir can be bricked.
- **Cleared after pre-flight passes**, before any driver writes — so a run rejected without touching the
  index leaves an existing marker intact, while a crash mid-crawl leaves the index visibly unattested.
  **Written only on the success path**, after every partition finalized. Never write it on a failure
  path, and never move the clear earlier than the last check that can still reject the run.
- Body is `key=value` lines (`xdu`, `completed_at`, `files`, `bytes`, `vanished`, `errors`,
  `lossy_paths`), so an `--allow-errors` run still records how much it skipped.
- All three readers call `lib::index_completion_warning` → a **soft stderr warning**, never a refusal
  (the index is still queryable). The read is size-capped (`MARKER_READ_LIMIT`) and must not block, so a
  FIFO or an enormous file left at that path cannot hang or exhaust a reader.
- **Known limitation (recorded, not fixed):** the marker describes the whole index but its counts come
  from one run, so a `--partition`-scoped run clears and rewrites it from its own stats and can retire a
  still-correct warning — `issues/marker-scoped-run-attestation.md`. Do not fix this incidentally; it
  needs its own pass.

## 2c. Fail-loud crawl errors; `--allow-errors` is opt-in

- **Default:** a walk or stat error fails the run **non-zero** with a diagnostic naming the path and
  errno, and **no marker is written**. This is the invariant that prevents a silently-incomplete index:
  jwalk emits one `Err` in place of an unreadable subtree's entire contents, so swallowing it loses
  arbitrarily many files while still exiting 0.
- **`--allow-errors` must stay opt-in.** It counts and reports skipped entries, exits 0, and records
  `errors=N` in the marker. Never make tolerance the default; never let it suppress the per-entry stderr
  report.

## 3. Partition scheme

- Layout is `<index>/<partition>/NNNNNN.parquet`, `partition` = a top-level subdirectory name.
- Loose files directly under the indexed root go to the reserved partition **`__root__`**
  (`ROOT_PARTITION`, defined in `lib.rs` as an index-layout constant and re-exported by `crawl`),
  crawled at `max_depth(1)`; the two never overlap (no file double-counted).
- **Reserved names are a class, not a list of facts.** `<index>/` holds exactly two kinds of entry:
  partition directories, and the reserved `COMPLETION_MARKER` dotfile. `lib::RESERVED_INDEX_NAMES`
  pairs every claimed name with what claims it, and `crawl::build_work_queue` **iterates that list** to
  **reject** a top-level source directory bearing one, with a clear error, **unconditionally** — even
  when a `--partition` filter would have excluded it, because the collision is with the on-disk layout,
  not with the selection. A change that reserves a **new** name at the index root must add it to that
  list in the same commit; the guard then covers it by construction rather than by being remembered.
  - `__root__` would collide with the synthetic partition — both write `000000.parquet` into the same
    directory and each `finalize` prunes the other's chunks.
  - `.xdu-complete` would be created as a *directory* at the marker path, so the run cannot write its
    attestation (`EISDIR`) and **no later run, from any source tree, can clear it** (`EPERM`) — a
    correct index reported as a failed run, and a bricked outdir until someone `rmdir`s it by hand.
  - Both directions matter: readers' `*/*.parquet` glob never mistakes the marker *for* a partition
    (it is a dotfile), and this guard is what stops a partition being written *over* the marker. When
    reviewing a diff that adds a reserved on-disk name, ask both questions.
- Chunk ids are zero-padded sequential; readers glob `*/*.parquet`.
- `lib::index_glob(index, partition)` is the **one** place this layout becomes a `read_parquet` glob;
  all three readers go through it. Do not hand-build the glob in a reader.

## 4. `xdu-rm` destructive safety — read before touching `src/bin/xdu-rm.rs`

- Default requires an interactive `y/N` confirmation (anything but `y`/`yes` aborts, deleting nothing);
  `--dry-run` performs **zero** deletions; `--force` skips the prompt; empty match set prints a
  message and exits 0.
- `--safe` re-`stat`s each file immediately before unlink and skips it if the current metadata no
  longer matches the query (the stale-index guard). It must re-verify **every** filter it is combined
  with — today it checks only atime (`--older-than`) and size (`--max-size`); `--min-size`,
  `--newer-than`, and `--pattern` are **gaps** and the man page overclaims. Closing that gap must not
  weaken any existing check.
- **Any deletion (or previewable action) combined with `--limit` MUST carry a deterministic
  `ORDER BY`** so `--dry-run` and the real run select **identical** rows. A `LIMIT` without `ORDER BY`
  returns an arbitrary/unstable subset.

## 5. DuckDB injection surface (all readers)

- Every user-supplied value that reaches `read_parquet(...)` or a `WHERE`/`LIKE` clause is an
  injection surface: `--pattern`, `--partition` (`-u`), and the index path. Today only `--pattern` is
  escaped (single-quote doubling); partition names and index paths are interpolated **raw**.
- Route all such values through **one** validated escaping/quoting helper (or bound parameters). Numeric
  filters (`i64`) are injection-safe by type. Forbid raw `format!` of a partition name / index path
  into SQL — in the destructive `xdu-rm` a quote or `../`/glob-meta could escape the intended partition.

## 6. Unix-only

- `std::os::unix::fs::MetadataExt` is load-bearing: `atime()` for access time and `blocks()`×512 for
  `SizeMode::DiskUsage`. Do not introduce code paths that assume portability.
- A future S3 / cross-platform source (roadmap Phase 4) must special-case — S3 objects have no atime.

## 7. Shared rayon-pool concurrency (`src/bin/xdu.rs`)

- A **single** `Parallelism::RayonExistingPool` backs **all** jwalk walkers; up to `--jobs` driver
  `std::thread`s pull partitions from a `Mutex<VecDeque>` work queue; rayon work-stealing balances
  directory reads across active walkers so one huge partition can't starve the rest.
- `std::thread::scope` joins the drivers; the first `Err`/panic surfaces as the process result
  (non-zero exit). Thread budget: N pool + C drivers + 1 main. Preserve this shape.

## 8. Symlinks excluded

- `follow_links(false)` + `entry.file_type().is_file()` before recording — the index holds only
  regular files. Don't start following symlinks (double-counting / traversal risk).

## 9. `SortMode` age inversion (must stay consistent SQL ↔ in-memory)

- `age-desc` = oldest first = `atime ASC`; `age-asc` = newest first = `atime DESC` (inverted by
  design). The SQL builders (`to_order_by` / `to_partition_order_by`) and `xdu-view`'s in-memory
  `sort_entries` must agree; directories-first applies only to `Name` sort.

## 10. CLI single source of truth (`src/cli.rs`)

- `src/cli.rs` is the one definition of every flag; `gen-completions` emits completions from it and
  `doc/*.scd` man pages describe it — completions/man cannot advertise a flag the binaries lack.
- **A CLI change updates the affected `doc/*.scd` in the same commit.** Prefer clap `ValueEnum` /
  `value_parser` over free-form `String` validated late (so completion/help offer valid values).
- The `-p` overload is real (partition in `xdu`, pattern in the query tools; partition is `-u`
  there) — change both sides coherently, never one in isolation.

## 11. Altitude / testability

- Binary targets stay thin: arg parse, terminal setup/teardown, the event loop. All parsing,
  formatting, file-type sniffing, SQL-building, and state-transition logic belongs in the `xdu`
  library so `tests/` and unit tests can reach it. (This is the root cause of the untested 2487-line
  `xdu-view.rs`.) Model the TUI as a pure state machine where feasible (`update(&mut App, Action)`
  with no terminal I/O).

## 12. TUI terminal safety (`src/bin/xdu-view.rs`)

- Raw mode + alternate screen must be restored on **every** exit path **including panic** — via a
  `Drop` guard or panic hook, **not** plain sequential code after the event loop (`panic = "abort"`
  is set in `Cargo.toml`, so an unwind won't run trailing restore code).
- Sanitize previewed file bytes (`strip_ansi`) before any line reaches ratatui (terminal-escape
  injection from attacker-controlled file contents). Slice on char boundaries, never raw byte indices
  computed from a display width.

## 13. Project conventions (same-commit / packaging) — violations are HIGH, not CRITICAL

- **Version is single-sourced from `Cargo.toml`** — never hardcode a version in `src/`; read it from
  `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`. The `-V`/`--version` **flag does not exist**: no `#[command(...)]` in
  `src/cli.rs` sets `version`, so all four binaries reject it while all four `doc/*.scd` document it.
  That is a recorded defect — [`issues/version-flag-missing.md`](../../issues/version-flag-missing.md)
  — not a convention to reason from.
- `share/` is a **generated** artifact (man via `scdoc` from `doc/*.scd`; completions via
  `gen-completions` from `src/cli.rs`), git-ignored, rebuilt in CI and by `/xdu-release`; CI asserts
  it generates. `.scd` sources carry no version string (a pure version bump doesn't touch them).
- **`doc/*.scd` authoring is its own footgun** — `scdoc` publishes a **wrong page at exit 0** (a
  mis-escaped `*` turned `_OUTDIR_/*/*.parquet` into `OUTDIR//.parquet`; a line beginning with `.`
  loses that period), so a green render gate proves nothing about the text. The escaping and
  line-start rules are single-sourced in `AGENTS.md`'s **Commands** section — read them before
  touching a `.scd`, and do not restate them here. Reviewing a `.scd` change means reading the
  published text (`scdoc < f.scd | mandoc -Tutf8 | col -b`), never exit 0 alone.
- **Asserting a literal survived is a separate step, and it must be layout-insensitive.** `mandoc`
  breaks lines wherever the fill lands, including *inside* a token, so an un-normalized `grep` calls
  an intact literal missing; `col -b` also indents with TABs. Match the way CI does — pipe the page
  through `| tr -d '[:space:]'` and strip the literal the same way. A local check that skips this can
  be green on homebrew `scdoc` (which escapes hyphen-minus) and red on the distro package (which does
  not). This normalization is **one rule in three places** — `AGENTS.md`'s Commands section, the
  `Assert critical literals` step in `.github/workflows/test.yaml`, and this bullet — and changing it
  is a same-commit obligation across all three, like the CLI↔man-page rule.
- **A literal that occurs more than once is asserted by COUNT, not presence.** `grep -q` is satisfied
  by whichever copy survived, so corrupting one of two occurrences passes a presence check while CI
  fails. The gate's `Nx:LITERAL` spec asserts exactly N (today `2x:.partial suffix`), and `AGENTS.md`'s
  Commands section documents the matching local form — a presence-only local check on a duplicated
  literal cannot predict CI however well it normalizes. Counting is also what makes the strip
  dangerous in the other direction: fusing two adjacent tokens is at worst a false *green* for
  presence but a false *red* for a count, so a counted needle must be specific enough that fusion
  cannot synthesize it (`.partial suffix`, never bare `.partial`). Adding, removing or re-counting a
  literal carries the same three-place same-commit obligation as the normalization above.
- Release tarball layout — `bin/{xdu,xdu-find,xdu-view,xdu-rm}` +
  `share/{man/man1/*.1, bash-completion/completions/*, zsh/site-functions/*}` — matches `install.sh`
  extraction exactly; keep them in lockstep.
- Non-TTY runs keep **stdout** clean/pipeable (progress and status go to **stderr**).
- Reuse shared helpers; do not duplicate logic across bins or reimplement production logic in tests.
- Comments are declarative statements of the invariant / the *why*; **never embed `spec/` `R#`/`P#`
  ids in source** (they restart per feature and collide across branches).
- Pre-release gate (mirrored by CI and `/xdu-release`): `cargo fmt --all -- --check`,
  `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` all pass clean.
