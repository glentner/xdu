## Problem

An index built as root across a whole center describes every tenant on it, and nothing in the
current tool chain can hand a tenant only their slice. DuckDB has no user model, no accounts and no
row-level security; it is a library running inside the caller's process with the caller's
credentials, so a filter applied client-side is a convenience and not a boundary. Anyone who can
open the index files reads all of them, whatever the reader was asked to display.

That leaves exactly two enforcement points: the operating system, or a process the caller does not
control. The OS route was explored and rejected in the same design pass — file modes express unions
and not the intersections real permission chains produce, and a mode baked at crawl time keeps
granting access after the underlying directory is locked down, durably, because a reader can copy
the chunk while it is still readable.

## Why it was deferred

New work, not a factory-pass deferral. It is the core of the 2026-09-11 redesign of
[`access-scoped-queries.md`](access-scoped-queries.md). Architecturally the largest item in that
stack: expect dedicated research and sub-phases at promotion.

## Outcome / vision

`xdu-api` is the only reader with access to a shared index. It authenticates the caller, resolves
them to a set of visibility classes, answers typed API operations with rows scoped to that set, and
records what it answered. The index is read-only, so the service is stateless: N replicas behind a
load balancer, no coordination.

DuckDB runs hardened and locked — `enable_external_access=false`, `allowed_directories`, extension
autoload/autoinstall/community off, then `lock_configuration=true`, with the index attached *before*
the lock. That posture is only reachable with the index on local disk, which points at object
storage as the distribution mechanism and replicas holding local copies, rather than
range-requesting per query. There is no statement-timeout setting, so query runtime is bounded by
interrupting from the handler.

Aggregates report what the caller can see, matching `du` semantics, and count what was withheld.
Reporting a true total across invisible rows would turn the service into a differencing oracle —
watch a subtree total move across generations and learn about files you cannot see — and reporting a
filtered total silently would contradict `lfs quota` with no explanation. Stating both numbers is
the honest option.

Serving queries rather than handing out data also means grants are revocable: nothing is disclosed
permanently, so permission staleness collapses to the crawl interval plus the group-cache TTL.

## Sketch of the acceptance criteria

Draft R-IDs, to be firmed up at promotion.

- **R1** — The index store *shall not* be readable by the principals the service serves; `xdu-api`
  *shall* be the only reader with access to it.
- **R2** — *When* an authenticated caller issues an API operation, `xdu-api` *shall* return only
  rows whose visibility class is in the class set resolved for that caller.
- **R3** — *While* serving, the DuckDB connection *shall* have external access disabled and its
  configuration locked, so no operation can read or write a path outside the index.
- **R4** — *If* an operation exceeds its time or memory budget, *then* `xdu-api` *shall* interrupt
  it and return an error rather than let it run.
- **R5** — Aggregates *shall* be computed over the caller's visible rows only and *shall* report the
  count of entries withheld.
- **R6** — `xdu-api` *shall* record an audit entry per query: principal, operation, index
  generation, timestamp.
- **R7** — A bulk result *shall* be paginated under a documented cap rather than streamed unbounded.

## Notes

- Depends on: [`index-visibility-classification.md`](index-visibility-classification.md),
  [`shared-index-api-contract.md`](shared-index-api-contract.md),
  [`shared-index-authentication.md`](shared-index-authentication.md), and S3 as an index target for
  distribution.
- Related: [`shared-index-deployment-guards.md`](shared-index-deployment-guards.md) enforces R1 at
  startup.
- Found by: shared-index design pass, 2026-09-11.
