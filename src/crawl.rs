//! The index-build crawl hot path, lifted out of the `xdu` binary so its

//!
//! Only the crawler pulls this in; the reader tools (`xdu-find`/`xdu-view`/`xdu-rm`)
//! never touch it. The pieces here are pure or near-pure: work-queue construction,
//! per-file record building, and the `PartitionBuffer` that accumulates records and
//! finalizes them atomically. The concurrency scaffold (shared rayon pool, driver
//! threads, `thread::scope` error propagation) stays in `src/bin/xdu.rs`.
