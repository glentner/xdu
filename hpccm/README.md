# hpccm

Container specs for xdu, generated with [HPC Container Maker][hpccm].

`xdu.py` is the recipe. `xdu.def` and `xdu.docker` are generated from it and
committed, so change the recipe and regenerate rather than editing them
directly. A handy Makefile is provided to simplify operations.

| file | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `xdu.py` | the HPCCM recipe |
| `xdu.def` | generated Apptainer/Singularity definition |
| `xdu.docker` | generated Dockerfile |
| `Makefile` | regenerates the specs, builds the images |
| `.gitattributes` | marks the specs as generated |

## Usage

    make            regenerate xdu.def and xdu.docker
    make sif        build xdu.sif with apptainer, or singularity
    make image      build the xdu docker image
    make help       every target, and the current variable values

Recipe options — `version`, `prefix`, `runtime_base` — pass through `USERARGS`
verbatim:

    make -B USERARGS='--userarg version=1.2.3 prefix=/usr/local'

The rules key off the recipe name, so adding a second recipe `foo.py` here also
gives you `make foo`, `make foo.def`, `make foo.sif` and `make foo.image`.

## What it builds

A two-stage image holding the four binaries — `xdu`, `xdu-find`, `xdu-view`,
`xdu-rm` — plus man pages and shell completions, taken from the published
release tarball. The download runs in a throwaway first stage, keeping `curl`
out of the finished image, and the architecture is resolved inside the
container from `uname -m`, so one spec serves both x86_64 and aarch64.

Generating the Apptainer definition by hand needs `--singularity-version=3.2`,
without which hpccm silently emits only the first stage. The Makefile passes
it as its default, and the recipe refuses to generate below it rather than
letting that pass quietly.

## How this differs from the top-level Dockerfile

The top-level `Dockerfile` **compiles xdu from source**; this recipe
**installs a released binary**. So it needs no Rust toolchain and finishes in
seconds rather than minutes, and it also yields an Apptainer definition — but
it can only install released tags, not an arbitrary commit.

**Why trixie, not bookworm.** The released binaries are built on Ubuntu 24.04
and currently need glibc 2.38 (`xdu-find`, `xdu-rm`) and 2.39 (`xdu-view`).
Bookworm ships 2.36 and cannot run them; the top-level Dockerfile is unaffected
because it compiles against bookworm's own glibc. The runtime stage guards this
by running `--version` on all four binaries, so an incompatible base fails the
build instead of producing an image that dies on first use. Should the release
workflow move to an older glibc, `runtime_base` can go back to bookworm.

**Man pages and shell completions.** The release tarball ships them, so this
recipe includes them; the top-level Dockerfile cannot, because `.dockerignore`
keeps `doc/` out of its build context. The image has no `man`, so they are not
very useful unless copied from the container onto the host.

## Caveats

Container runscript is set to run `xdu`, for the `xdu-***` tools use `exec`
(e.g. `apptainer exec xdu.sif xdu-view`). It is on you to ensure that all
relevant filesystems are bind-mounted into the container (via suitable default
settings and/or explicit `-B` options).
